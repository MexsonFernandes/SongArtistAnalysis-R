# `Song Artist Analysis using geniusR`

R script to analyze two different music artist based on the words used in albums or songs. I have used geniusR library to gather the songs lyrics.

# Requirements (R libraries):
  - geniusR (to mine song lyrics)
  - tidyverse (to manipulate data and for visualization)
  - tidytext (to tokenize dataset, remove stop words and count word frequency).
